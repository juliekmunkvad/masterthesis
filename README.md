# masterthesis
This entire GitHub repository consists of all the code which has been used to create the results for my thesis.

The code has been cleaned up and should be able to be run from end to end. Note that there are places for changes to be made manually to get all the numbers in, for example Tables 2 and 5. Also, since we are using simulated data and random initialization of the artificial neural networks, it may not be possible to obtain the exact same results as those reported in the thesis when running the code.
